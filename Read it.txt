The template can be used in online and offline ways. For the former (highly
recommended), Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com) is a collaborative cloudbased LaTeX editor used for writing, editing and publishing scientific documents,
which is much easy to use and friendly.
For the latter, one can use Texstudio, which is a very popular yet free software
package (https://www.texstudio.org/). When using Texstudio, the compiling command is Xelatex. To make Texstudio work, one need to first install Miktex,
see https://miktex.org/. We happen to find, rather rarely, that a successful
compiling may depend on the version of Texstudio. In any case, we recommend
the latest version of Texstudio.
